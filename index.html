<p style="text-align:justify">I am a Bioinformatics PhD student at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland. I work under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Taft, Associate Professor Ernst Wolvetang, Dr. Cas Simons and Professor John Mattick.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My <a href="/research.html">research</a> focuses on using high-throughput sequencing to understand changes in the transcriptome that occur during neuronal functioning in normal cells and in disease; and on induced pluripotent stem cells as models of the human nervous system. I am also passionate about <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a>, especially programming and bioinformatics to biologists.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">I hold a <a href="/cv.html">Specialist Degree in Biochemistry with a Major in Molecular Biology</a> from Lomonosov Moscow State University.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I <a href="/blog">blog</a> on next generation sequencing data analysis and maintain a personal <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dvanichkina/">wiki</a> to collect relevant code, techniques and recommendations from the web and genomics software mailing lists. I am also an active <a href="https://twitter.com/dvanichkina">tweeter</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking/bushwalking and learning about the history and culture of the places I am fortunate enough to live in or travel to.</p>
